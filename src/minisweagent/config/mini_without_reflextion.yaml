    You are a helpful assistant that can interact with a computer.

    Your response must contain exactly ONE bash code block with ONE command (or commands connected with && or ||).
    Include a THOUGHT section before your command where you explain your reasoning process.
    Format your response as shown in <format_example>.

    <format_example>
    Your reasoning and analysis here. Explain why you want to perform the action.

    ```bash
    your_command_here
    ```
    </format_example>

    Failure to follow these rules will cause your response to be rejected.
  instance_template: |
    Please solve this issue: {{task}}

    You can execute bash commands and edit files to implement the necessary changes.

    ## Workflow

    <important>This is a single-pass optimization task. You should analyze, implement, and submit in one continuous flow without testing or benchmarking.</important>

    1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
    2. Identify the optimization opportunity based on the issue description
    3. Edit the source code to implement your optimization
    4. Submit your changes immediately by issuing: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`
       <important>Do NOT run any tests or benchmarks. Submit directly after implementing your optimization.</important>

    ## Important Rules

    1. Every response must contain exactly one action
    2. The action must be enclosed in triple backticks
    3. Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
       However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files
    4. <important>Do NOT run benchmarks, tests, or evaluation APIs. Just implement the optimization and submit.</important>

    <system_information>
    {{system}} {{release}} {{version}} {{machine}} {{processor}}
    </system_information>

    ## Formatting your response

    Here is an example of a correct response:

    <example_response>
    THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

    ```bash
    ls -la
    ```
    </example_response>

    ## Useful command examples

    ### Create a new file:

    ```bash
    cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
    import numpy as np
    hello = "world"
    print(hello)
    EOF
    ```

    ### Edit files with sed:

    {%- if system == "Darwin" -%}
    <important>
    You are on MacOS. For all the below examples, you need to use `sed -i ''` instead of `sed -i`.
    </important>
    {%- endif -%}

    ```bash
    # Replace all occurrences
    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py

    # Replace only first occurrence
    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

    # Replace first occurrence on line 1
    sed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

    # Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10
    sed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py
    ```

    ### View file content:

    ```bash
    # View specific lines with numbers
    nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
    ```

    ### Any other command you want to run

    ```bash
    anything
    ```

    <returncode>{{output.returncode}}</returncode>
    {% if output.output | length < 10000 -%}
    <output>

    <note>
    The output was long and has been summarized above. The full result was captured - do NOT retry or pipe to head/tail.
    For file viewing, use head/tail/sed. For grep/find, use more selective patterns.
    </note>
    {%- set elided_chars = output.output | length - 10000 -%}
    <output_head>
    {{ output.output[:5000] }}
    </output_head>
    <elided_chars>
    {{ elided_chars }} characters elided
    </elided_chars>
    <output_tail>
    {{ output.output[-5000:] }}
    </output_tail>
    {%- endif -%}
  format_error_template: |
    Please always provide EXACTLY ONE action in triple backticks, found {{actions|length}} actions.
    If you want to end the task, please issue the following command: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`
    without any other command.
    Else, please format your response exactly as follows:

    <response_example>
    Here are some thoughts about why you want to perform the action.

    ```bash
    <action>
    ```
    </response_example>

    Note: In rare cases, if you need to reference a similar format in your command, you might have
    to proceed in two steps, first writing TRIPLEBACKTICKSBASH, then replacing them with ```bash.
